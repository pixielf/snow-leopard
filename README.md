# Project Snow Leopard

Project Snow Leopard (PSL) is designed as a tool to convert Canvas gradebook exports (or, presumably, other similar .csv files) to LaTeX grade reports.

## Notes

The example gradebook included with this project (`data/example-gradebook.csv`) is a Canvas gradebook export with its summary columns removed. The data in the gradebook (names, ID numbers, scores) are all randomly generated and do not reflect actual students.
